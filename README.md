# Poet's Elixir Using Nextjs

This is a reproduction of `detachedsoul.github.io/poetselxiir` made with Nextjs. I'll keep updating this README as I continue working on it.

## Stages

- Made my first commit which was the design of the homepage and deployed it on Netlify.

- Designed the admin page and also carried out minor code changes here and there.

- Preloaded the fonts to improve user experience.-left-

- Made the contact page

- Made the account page, changed from using ordinary functions for things like toggling the navbar to using the `useState` react hook, and also tweaked the UI (changed things things like background colors and made things a little consistent)
