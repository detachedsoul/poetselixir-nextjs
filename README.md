# Poet's Elixir Using Nextjs

This is a reproduction of `detachedsoul.github.io/poetselxiir` made with Nextjs. I'll keep updating this README as I continue working on it.

## Stages

- Made my first commit which was the design of the homepage and deployed it on Netlify.

The live demo of my progress can be found on [https://poetselixir.netlify.app](https://poetselixir.netlify.app)
